# Computer Vision Classification Models

This  contains popular computer vision classification modelsï¼Œwhich is mainly aimed at scientific research developers. The code is relatively simple but comprehensive.These models are widely used in the field of computer vision for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image recognition.
## Models Included

1. LeNet-5: A classic convolutional neural network model proposed by Yann LeCun in 1998 for handwritten digit recognition.

2. AlexNet: A deep convolutional neural network model proposed by Alex Krizhevsky et al. in 2012, which achieved significant performance improvements in the ImageNet image classification challenge.

3. VGGNet: A deep convolutional neural network model developed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford in 2014. It is known for its deep architecture with small convolutional filters.

4. GoogLeNet: A convolutional neural network model proposed by the Google Research team in 2014. It introduced the concept of Inception modules to efficiently reduce the number of parameters in the network.

5. ResNet: A residual neural network model developed by Microsoft Research in 2015. ResNet addresses the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks by introducing shortcut connections and bottleneck structures.

6. InceptionNet: A convolutional neural network model introduced by the Google Research team in 2014. It incorporates multiple scales of convolutions and uses 1x1 convolutions within the Inception module to reduce computational complexity.

7. DenseNet: A densely connected convolutional neural network model proposed by Gao Huang et al. in 2016. DenseNet enables direct connections between all layers, facilitating feature propagation and reuse.
